# Shortcuts Dashboard Widget

Pipit Shortcuts is a Perch Runway dashboard widget. It allows you to select menu sections managed in Perch Runway's Menu Manager to be listed in the widget.

## Requirements

- Perch Runway 3.0 or higher
- PHP 7+

Note this widget is for **Perch Runway only** as it relies on Perch Runway's Menu Manager. So it can't be used on regular Perch.


## Installation

- Download the latest version
- Unzip the download
- Place the `pipit_shortcuts` folder in `perch/addons/apps`



## Configuration

### Menu Manager

- Go to Settings in the control panel
- Go to Menu Manager

You can add new menu sections there. Active sections appear on the left sidebar.

If you want to have a section listed in the widget but not on the sidebar, you can deactivate the section. You'll still be able to select it to be listed for the widget.


### Registering Menu Sections for the Widget

- Go to the Shortcuts app from the sidebar
- Select the sections you want to list in the widget from the select box
